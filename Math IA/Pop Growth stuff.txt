 Ideas:
1. Model Owl population in Switzerland:
  - Exponential graph:
	- Number of owl (Y) per Year (X)  (Exponential graph)
  - Logistic graph

  - Expansion ideas: 
        - Finding the optimal population for owls
	- One idea could be finding a function that fits those number you obtained and try to fit a function to it. 
	  You can use algebra/Matrices/ or a computer software and compare the R2 and other correlation values to come up with a certain function, 
	  which you will use to predict the population in the future.

2. How does a disease spread through a population:
	- How long would it take for us all to be wiped out if a deadly influenza spreads throughout the population?

3. Coverage: Calculation of rate of deforestation, and afforestation. How long will our forests last?:



Maths that could be used:
- Logistic graph
- Exponentional graph
- Differential equations
- Piecewise functions (https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/functions-piecewise.html)
- Different equations to model population growth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_model#Equations) (I wanna look at Logistic growth and Species-area relationship)
