1. Add permissions (you can CTRL + F "internet", by default it is commented out):
    TODO: Add storage permissions (and others if there are)

2. Add requirements (see requirements.txt)


3. When deploying add the verbose flag (-v), full command: buildozer -v android debug deploy run

4. Weird bug with httplib2:
    - https://github.com/kivy/buildozer/issues/135

5. Weird issue with bs4 (buildozer has no recipe):
    - Replace bs4 with beautifulsoup4 in buildozer.spec requirements

6. Make sure to accept the sdk license in the spec file
