1. Add permissions (you can CTRL + F "internet", by default it is commented out):
    TODO: Add storage permissions (and others if there are)

2. Add requirements (see requirements.txt)

3. When deploying add the verbose flag (-v), full command: buildozer -v android debug deploy run

4. Weird bug with httplib2:
    - https://github.com/kivy/buildozer/issues/135

5. Weird issue with bs4 (buildozer has no recipe):
    - Replace bs4 with beautifulsoup4 in buildozer.spec requirements

6. Make sure to accept the sdk license in the spec file

7. Super important - Remove any super large files (in my case, the UIX folder)

8. Place the folder with all the code onto to the desktop

9. Make sure to clean and update buildozer before doing step 3


10. Buildozer debug: adb logcat *:S python:D


# Did not work
11. buildozer.spec: 
    # (bool) Use --private data storage (True) or --dir public storage (False)
    # OG value: "#android.private_storage = True"
    android.private_storage = False
