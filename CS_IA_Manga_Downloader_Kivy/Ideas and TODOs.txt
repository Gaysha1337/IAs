Ideas/Things to focus on:

How is this app gonna handle on going manga?
    Maybe send a notification? (how can I do this in python)

    Read:
        Gridlayout of downloaded manga
    Download:
        # Need to select which language the manga is gonna be in
        1.1: Gridlayout of most recent manga (user specifies grid dimensions)
        1.2: Recommendations:
            This would require the user to be signed into MAL
